## 学中文 – Learn to Read Chinese

This course is designed for **Spanish speakers** who want to learn how to **read** Mandarin Chinese—without
needing to learn how to speak it.

## Methodology

The course uses a **progressive, scaffolded learning approach**:

1. **One word at a time:** Each new word is introduced with its English translation.
2. **Sentences with known words:** All practice sentences contain only words you have already learned.
3. **Continuous story:** Vocabulary is presented within a progressive story about a boy named Ming (小明).
4. **No pinyin:** This course focuses exclusively on reading **simplified Chinese characters**, with no romanization.
